## Hi there, I'm Wesley ðŸ‘‹
I'm a coding architect at [Xebia](https://xebia.com) based in Antwerp, Belgium. Most of my work involves .NET / C# and Azure, creating ASP.NET Core web apps and APIs or cloud-native solutions.

### Connecting with me ðŸ”—
You can find me on various social platforms, the one I use the most are:

* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gotsharp.be)
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/wcabus)

If you're interested in sessions or workshops that I could deliver at your company or conference, have a look at my [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/wesley-cabus) page.

I can also be found on other platforms like [Mastodon](https://toot.community/@wesleycabus) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@wesleycabus), but as long as I can't crosspost, the ones above are your safest bets.
